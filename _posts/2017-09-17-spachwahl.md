>  Whatever the chosen language, the essence of programming is abstraction.
<cite>Niklaus Wirth</cite>

> When you choose a language, youre also choosing a community. The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could
> get to work on a project written in Python.<br/>
> And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the language you choose. Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages.
<cite>Phillip Greenspun</cite>
