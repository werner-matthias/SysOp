  Playing with pointers is like playing with fire. Fire is perhaps the most important tool known to man. Carefully used, fire brings enormous benefits; but when fire gets out of control, disaster strikes.- John Barnes



  You can either have software quality or you can have pointer arithmetic, but you cannot have both at the same time.- Bertrand Meyer
