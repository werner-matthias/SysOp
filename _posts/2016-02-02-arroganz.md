>  Don&#8217;t blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as an intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for &lsquo;the average programmer&rsquo; â€” you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner.
<cite>Edsger W. Dijkstra</cite>


>  I don&#8217;t know how many of you have ever met Dijkstra, but you probably know that arrogance in computer science is measured in nano-Dijkstras.-
<cite>Alan C. Kay</cite>
