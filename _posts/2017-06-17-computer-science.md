  In science, we reserve our highest honors for those who prove we were wrong. But in computer science&#8230;- Rob Pike



  A folk adage of the academic profession says, &lsquo;Anything which has to call itself a science isn&#8217;t.&rsquo; By this criterion, physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy may be sciences; political science, military science, social science, and computer science are not.- Fred Brooks
